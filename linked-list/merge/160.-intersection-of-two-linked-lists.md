# 160.Intersection of Two Linked Lists

[**160.Intersection of Two Linked Lists**](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/description/)

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:

```text
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
```

begin to intersect at node c1.

**Notes:**

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O\(n\) time and use only O\(1\) memory.

**Solutions:**

* Add list A to end of list B and add list B to end of list A
* If they have intersection, it is located at the end of combined list at same index
* Time: O\(m + n\)

```text
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
       
        if (headA == null || headB == null) return null;
        ListNode a = headA, b = headB;
        
        while (a != b) {
            a = (a == null ? headB : a.next);
            b = (b == null ? headA : b.next);
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```
