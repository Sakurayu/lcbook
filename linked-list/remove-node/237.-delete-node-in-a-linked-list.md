# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List

[**237. Delete Node in a Linked List**](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/)

Write a function to delete a node \(except the tail\) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Supposed the linked list is `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` and you are given the third node with value `3`, the linked list should become `1 -> 2 -> 4` after calling your function.

**My Solutions:** 

method是 void 删除节点。把pass in 的node的val变成下一个node的val，以及把node指向下下个

```text
public class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        if (node == null || node.next == null) node = null;
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
        return;
    }
}
```
