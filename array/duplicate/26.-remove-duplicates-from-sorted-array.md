# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array / 27. Remove Element / 283. Move Zeroes

 [**26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)\*\*\*\*

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only _once_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

_**My Solutions:**_

建立两个指针，i表示最终结果的正确位置，j表示for loop循环数组的位置。i初始定为0，j初始定为1。如果i和j的数不一样，i前进一格，且i index所在的数和j index所在的数变成一样。不然的话j继续前进

```text
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int i = 0; 
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[j]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```



[ **27. Remove Element**](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/)\*\*\*\*

Given an array _nums_ and a value _val_, remove all instances of that value [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.

Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

题目要求把非val的数字移到数组最前，且返回这些数字的长度，顺序可以打乱。用一个指针记录非val数所在的最大index。随着for loop iterates，如果当前数非val，则把这个指针位置记为当前数，且pointer++。这样所有非val数都被移到数组的最前

```text
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;

        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] != val){
                nums[index] = nums[i];
                index++;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
}
```



[ **283. Move Zeroes**](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/)\*\*\*\*

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note**:

1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

和27题相同。用一个指针记录非零数所在的最大index。随着for loop iterates，如果当前数非零，则把这个指针位置记为当前数，且pointer++。这样所有非零数都被移到数组的最前。最后如果pointer不等于数组长度，补足末尾的数都为零

```text
public class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int len = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != 0) {
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count++;
            }
        }
        while (count != len) {
            nums[count] = 0;
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```
