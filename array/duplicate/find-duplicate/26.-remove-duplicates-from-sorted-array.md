# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

 [**26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/)\*\*\*\*

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only _once_ and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```text
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

_**My Solutions:**_

建立两个指针，i表示最终结果的正确位置，j表示for loop循环数组的位置。i初始定为0，j初始定为1。如果i和j的数不一样，i前进一格，且i index所在的数和j index所在的数变成一样。不然的话j继续前进

```text
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int i = 0; 
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[j]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```
