# 212. Word Search II

[ **212. Word Search II**](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/description/)

Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"] and board =
[
  ['o','a','a','n'],
  ['e','t','a','e'],
  ['i','h','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]

Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

**Note:**  
You may assume that all inputs are consist of lowercase letters `a-z`.

**Hint:**

* You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?
* If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: [Implement Trie \(Prefix Tree\)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree/) first.

_**My Solutions:**_

用trie做，提高效率。 将要搜索的单词先添加到trie中, 然后从地图board的每一个元素搜索, 如果往上下左右搜索的时候其元素可以在字典树中找到, 那么就继续dfs搜索下去, 并且如果搜索到某个结点的时候发现到这个结点构成了一个单词, 那么就将单词添加到结果集合中。如果在trie中无法找到这个元素, 那么就结束当前分支的搜索.
