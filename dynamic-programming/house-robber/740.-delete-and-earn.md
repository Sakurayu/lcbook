# 740. Delete and Earn

\*\*\*\*[ **740. Delete and Earn**](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn/description/)\*\*\*\*

Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
Output: 9
Explanation: 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
```

**Note:**

The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.

Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

_**My Solutions:**_

对每拿一个数字来说，可以拿到所有这个数字的总和，但是不能拿到和比它小一位或者第一位的数字。因此，这个问题类似于house robber，如果拿了i-1，就不能拿i

Time: We performed a radix sort instead, so our complexity is O\(N+W\), where W is the range of allowable values for nums\[i\]. 

Space : O\(W\), the size of our count.

```text
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        /*优化的话可以找到最大值，用这个值作为dp长度
        int max = 0;
        for (int i : nums) max = Math.max(i, max);
        int[] counts = new int[max + 1];
        for (int i : nums) counts[i]++;
        */
        
        int[] dp = new int[10001];
        for (int i : nums) dp[i] += i;
        
        for (int i = 2; i < dp.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1]);
        }
        
        return dp[10000];
    }
}
```
